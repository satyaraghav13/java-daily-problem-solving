## Problem
Write a Java program to count vowels in a given string.

## Input
interview    , Genuine , Consequence

## Output
4

## Approach
Traverse the string and check if the character is a vowel.








## Problem   2
Write a Java program to reverse a given string.

## Input
"java"

## Output
"avaj"

## Constraint
- Do not use any inbuilt reverse method  And Build method 

## Approach
Traverse the string from end to start and build the reversed string.







## Problem     3
Write a Java program to count the occurrence of each character
in a given string.

## Input
"java"

## Output
j = 1
a = 2
v = 1

## Constraint
- Do not use any inbuilt frequency methods.

## Approach
Traverse the string character by character and use a HashMap
to store character counts.






## Problem   4
Write a Java program to check whether a given string is a palindrome.

## Input
"madam"

## Output
Palindrome

## Constraint
- Do not use inbuilt reverse methods.

## Approach
Compare characters from start and end of the string.
If all matching pairs are equal, the string is a palindrome.









## Problem 5
Write a Java program to check whether two given strings are anagrams.

## Input
String 1: "listen"
String 2: "silent"

## Output
Anagram

## Constraint
- Do not use inbuilt sorting methods.
- Comparison should be case-insensitive.

## Approach
Count the frequency of each character in both strings.
If both frequency maps are equal, the strings are anagrams.
