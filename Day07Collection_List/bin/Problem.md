# Java Collection Framework – List Traversal & Removal

## 📌 Problem Statement
Write a Core Java program to demonstrate different ways of traversing a `List`
using:
- Normal `for` loop
- `Iterator` while 
- Enhanced `for-each` loop

Also explain which traversal method allows safe removal of elements
during iteration.

---

## 🧾 Requirements
- Use `ArrayList`
- Store heterogeneous elements
- Traverse the list using:
   - for loop
   - Iterator with while loop
   - for-each loop
- Print list size before and after traversal

Note>>>“Elements can be removed in normal for or while loops, but removal is not allowed in the enhanced for-each loop; safe removal is only possible using Iterator.remove(). With While loop”

## 🧠 Key Concepts Covered
- Java Collection Framework
- List interface
- Iterator
- ConcurrentModificationException
- JDK 1.5 enhanced for-loop
